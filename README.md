Task 1: Data Normalization and Backend Processing

In this task, I learned how to handle and normalize real-world data received in different formats by converting it into a single standardized structure. I worked with JSON data, mapped and renamed fields, restructured nested and flat data, and addressed practical challenges such as converting ISO 8601 timestamps into milliseconds. I also used conditional logic to detect data formats and applied appropriate transformations, along with automated unit tests to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the processed data.


Task 2: System Design and Development Proposal

In this task, I learned how to analyze real-world requirements and translate them into a structured technical proposal. I gained experience in system design concepts, including secure intranet-based applications, authentication integration, and dashboard planning. The task also improved my understanding of project estimation, timeline planning, and professional technical documentation, helping me align technical solutions with business and industry requirements.
